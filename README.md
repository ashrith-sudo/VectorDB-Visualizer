# VectorDB Visualizer

An interactive, step-by-step simulation of the vector embedding and search lifecycle.

## Overview

VectorDB Visualizer is a TypeScript-based web application that helps users understand how vector embeddings are created, stored, and queried in a vector database. Through an intuitive UI, users can add documents, visualize their transformation into vectors, and perform similarity searches in real-time.

## Features

- **Document Embedding Simulation**: Enter text documents and watch as they are tokenized and converted into vector embeddings.
- **Vector Database Display**: View how embeddings are stored and indexed for efficient searching. Each vector is visualized as a point in high-dimensional space.
- **Similarity Search**: Execute queries against the stored vectors and see which documents match, including live similarity scores and animated feedback.
- **Step-by-Step Narration**: The system provides an interactive narration of each stage in the lifecycle, from input to retrieval.
- **Visual Embedding Breakdown**: Vectors are visually represented with color coding for each dimension, making it easy to grasp their structure and relative values.

## How It Works

1. **Add a Document**: Input any text. The application breaks it down into tokens and creates a deterministic vector embedding using a seeded pseudo-random generator.
2. **Store in Vector DB**: The vector is stored in a simulated database, ready for queries.
3. **Query the DB**: Enter a query, which is also embedded as a vector. The system compares it with stored vectors using cosine similarity.
4. **View Results**: Retrieved documents are ranked and highlighted based on similarity scores. Vectors and matches are visually displayed.

## Implementation Details

- **Frontend**: Built using React and TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive user interface.
- **Embedding**: Embeddings are generated by hashing the input string and producing a vector of fixed dimension (16) with values between -1 and 1.
- **Similarity Search**: Cosine similarity is used to compare vectors, with results sorted and top matches highlighted.
- **Visualization**: Vectors are displayed with color-coded cells corresponding to each dimension's value, and similarity is shown with gradients and highlights.
- **Types & Structure**: Strong typing is enforced using TypeScript. Core types include `Document`, `Vector`, `SearchResult`, and `FlowStep` for managing the simulation flow.

## Example

```text
Document: "The quick brown fox"
→ Tokenized
→ Embedded as Vector [0.12, -0.66, ..., 0.54]
→ Stored in DB

Query: "brown fox"
→ Embedded
→ Compared to stored vectors
→ Top matches returned and visualized
```
